- 1 What cannot be done :
   -> carbon footprint (too many missing data), no relevance
   -> Ideal conversion (ex: coca cola 50cl == coca cola 500ml or coca cola .5L, filters to detect that will not be 100% accurate)
       - although it might be attempted by removing the spaces and trying conversion, this can't account for every difference
       -> Duplication will need to be done with name AND EAN13
